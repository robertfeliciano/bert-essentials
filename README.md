Linux commands I have created and found essential to my productivity

Some of the commands are from a project I like to call Crash. It is an abbreviation for "Cruel Shell", like Bash is "Bourne Again Shell". This shell is cruel simply because it is not as good as Bash. When it doesn't work, Crash can also mean "Crap Shell".

Hopefully these commands also work on my custom operating system I am developing. We will see.
